The Law of Assumption: How Beliefs Shape Reality

(With neuroscientific and psychological evidence)

I believe the Law of Assumption works — not because of blind faith, but because science consistently shows that what we assume to be true about ourselves reshapes our brains, our behavior, and the outcomes we experience over time.

The Law of Assumption proposes that persistent assumptions act as internal truths that guide perception, emotion, and action. While often discussed in spiritual contexts, its core mechanism is strongly supported by neuroplasticity, mindset research, and self-fulfilling prophecy theory.

Belief as a Driver of Reality

Assumptions are not surface-level thoughts; they are identity-level expectations. Once established, they influence how individuals interpret situations, regulate emotions, and decide how to act.

Sociologist Robert K. Merton (1948) described this phenomenon as a self-fulfilling prophecy, where beliefs lead to behaviors that cause the belief to come true. This concept has since been validated across psychology, education, and behavioral science.

In short:
Expectation → behavior → outcome

This is the foundation of the Law of Assumption.

Stanford Research on Mindset and Assumption

Research conducted at Stanford University, particularly by psychologist Dr. Carol Dweck, demonstrates that assumptions about intelligence and ability significantly affect performance.

Individuals with a growth mindset—the assumption that abilities can be developed—show:

greater persistence in the face of difficulty

improved learning outcomes

increased resilience to failure

These effects occur not because of inherent talent differences, but because assumptions alter cognitive and behavioral responses to challenge (Dweck, 2006).

Stanford’s PERTS (Project for Education Research That Scales) lab has replicated and scaled these findings across large populations, confirming that belief systems can meaningfully alter real-world outcomes.

Neuroplasticity: How Assumptions Rewire the Brain

Neuroplasticity refers to the brain’s ability to reorganize itself in response to repeated thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. This phenomenon is widely accepted in neuroscience and supported by brain imaging research.

Repeated mental states strengthen associated neural circuits, making them more automatic over time (Doidge, 2007).

Stanford neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman explains that sustained attention and repeated internal states drive long-term neural change, meaning that what the brain repeatedly rehearses becomes its default mode of operation (Huberman, 2021).

Thus, when assumptions are repeated consistently, they become biologically embedded, shaping future perception and action.

Affirmations as Neural Conditioning

Affirmations are effective only when they reinforce plausible identity-based assumptions. Research on mental imagery and rehearsal shows that imagining an action activates the same neural networks as performing it physically.

A landmark study by Pascual-Leone et al. (1995) demonstrated that participants who mentally rehearsed piano exercises showed measurable cortical changes similar to those who physically practiced.

This supports the idea that affirmations and visualization function as mental training, not wishful thinking.

When affirmations are aligned with believable assumptions, they:

rehearse future responses

prime emotional regulation

condition behavior

This is why affirmations rooted in assumption—not fantasy—can influence reality.

Changing Time: A Neuroscientific Interpretation

When people say the Law of Assumption allows one to “change time,” this should not be interpreted literally. However, neuroscience shows that time perception, memory, and future prediction are malleable.

Memory is reconstructive, not fixed; each recall alters neural representation (Schacter, 1999). Similarly, the brain constantly predicts future outcomes based on current assumptions.

By changing assumptions, individuals can:

reinterpret past experiences

alter emotional responses to memory

change behavioral trajectories moving forward

In this way, assumptions reshape the lived timeline of one’s life, even though objective time remains unchanged.

Conclusion

The Law of Assumption is not a claim of supernatural control. It is a framework that aligns with well-established scientific principles:

Beliefs influence behavior (Merton, 1948)

Mindsets alter performance (Dweck, 2006)

Repetition reshapes the brain (Doidge, 2007)

Mental rehearsal changes neural structure (Pascual-Leone et al., 1995)

Different disciplines describe the same mechanism using different language. Whether framed spiritually or scientifically, the conclusion remains the same:

When assumptions change, brains change. When brains change, behavior changes. And when behavior changes consistently, reality follows.
